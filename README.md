# Onetap-V2-Reversal

Releasing due to most of this information being outdated (and the fact I don't give two shits about the CS:GO scene anymore)            

I worked on this for around a month a couple years ago... 
I have years worth of CS:GO P2C reversals just sitting idle in my filesystem, if there is enough attention here I will think about releasing newer reversals of OT.
